This is is a list of my skills which I have developed enough to be worth advertising professionally.
With each skill, I have created a feed that lists blog posts and projects I have created showcasing
that skill.

<ul>
    {% for skill in skills %}
    <li><a href="/skills/filter/{{ skill.name }}">{{ skill.name }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
