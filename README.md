Ben Croisdale's Personal Website
================================

This is the code for my personal website, run on [ben.croisdale.us](https://ben.croisdale.us). I've
made it open source mainly so that others can see how it is constructed in the hopes that this could
be useful. That said, I make no guarantees that this code is in any way 'best practice'. I've
followed good standards as best as I was able, but especially on the front-end it is entirely
possible or even likely that I've made some horrible mistake that will have me cursing myself a few
months down the line.

This is a learning process.

Check out my [gears file](gears.md) for a description of how the site works.
